# Extremes Impact Study

## Overview
The Extremes Study package is an extension of the Discretisation noise study package, which can be installed using the following command:

\```R
devtools::install_github('rgopikrishnan91/DiscNoise')
\```

This package provides tools and functions to analyze the impact of removing extremes from dependent variables, noise, and both noise and extremes on machine learning performance and interpretation.

## Datasets
You can access the datasets used in the Extremes Study package from the following link:

[Extremes Study Datasets](https://github.com/rgopikrishnan91/DiscNoise/releases/tag/dataset)

These datasets are specifically curated for the purpose of conducting analyses related to software engineering studies. They serve as valuable resources for understanding the effects of removing extremes and noise on model performance and interpretation.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Extremes Study package, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Extremes study package from this repository.

2. Download the required datasets from the provided link.

3. Load the Extremes Study package and the desired dataset into your R environment.

4. Utilize the functions and tools provided by the Extremes Study package to analyze the impact of removing extremes on machine learning performance and interpretation.

## Usage
The Extremes Study package offers a range of functions and capabilities for studying the effects of removing extremes. Some of the key features include:

- Removal of extremes from dependent variables, noise, and both noise and extremes.
- Evaluation of machine learning performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and AUC.
- Calculation of feature importance ranking after removing extremes.
- Analysis of the impact of extreme removal on model performance and interpretation.

Refer to the package documentation and function references for detailed information on how to use each feature effectively.
